# What I Did

My project doesn't look like much at the moment, and thats mostly because I'm still getting used to the gimp interface. I have a decent amount of experience using photoshop, but it has been a minute since I've done any photo editing so dusting off some of the cobwebs has been a challenge.I mostly worked on trying to figureout how to make one of my background images dualtone. I've looked at several tutorials online but they all seem to be using versions of gimp a little different than the one I have. The screanshot sc1 is a look at my screen as I'm struggling to tweak the settings of the image to get it to be dualtone. I've also spent a lot of time going through the pitt band photo archives trying to gather assets to use in my visual argument. There are tens of thousands of photos to pick from going back decades, which makes picking photos that would work well in my image a little daunting
